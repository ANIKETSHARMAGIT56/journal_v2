I love your good morning texts Drishti, Its all I need to have a better day always.
Nowadays we talk mostly everyday, I'm happy, relieved too, i havent practiced bansuri much since new year, but because of you, the spark has come back, I love you drishti.

and forgive me please , i made you uncomfortable with that anjili thing , and day before yesterday i even overreacted on the forgetting thing, I didnt pay attention to the anxiety attack thing you told me. Cant do much about it ,the regret is gonna persist.

I know there is a lot happening in your life but please dont lose your spark, its precious, you are talented and capable, you are priceless baby.

Just some days later ,My exams are gonna be over, I hope my life gets a bit more happening at least, Im tired of this monotonous life.

and for some months I've been interested in cybersecurity, most of the courses are cybersecurity and blockchain, i dont know much about blockchain at this point, as soon as exams get over im gonna start researching, ill start learning and maybe try to land an internship somewhere.

yours loving
Avyay
