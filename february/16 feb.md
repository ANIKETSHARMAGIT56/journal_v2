I'm starting to write this cuz i don't think I will have the chance to talk to you much for some month , maybe till may, and i just want my thoughts to reach you in any form, much like last year.

you asked me what do i think about you today, i answered honestly, you said sometimes you feel like im with you only to not make you feel bad, which is not at all true, at this point, i wanna build your self esteem, the thing you helped me build, just your presence is enough for me, i developed so much, im calmer, im more matured, im confident, im the best version of myself because of you, and most importantly, i stopped seeking validation from people. 

I just want you to stop making the mistakes that i made, well you will only learn from your own mistakes, thats how everything works but i can atleast help you out.

I think I kind of failed as a boyfriend, i couldnt fulfill your basic needs, but now that i realized ill try my best, i swear.
