I don't know how to describe this feeling, I feel anxiety, It was in the background, but in situations like now, when the foreground of my mind is empty its being amplified, there are so many things going on and nothing is bothering me much to be honest, I just feel like i'm healing a bit, anxiety is not that intense now, its gradually gone down, and its no where near the level it was previously. I feel fresh, and i think its one of those nights where i wont be able to sleep much, my eyes are sleepy, but unlike those other nights my mind is blank.

i have that much mental freedom that i can talk to myself again, which i didn't even notice i stopped. maybe it was around new year time. i was feeling a bit mentally absent, i was talking to other people more than myself, maybe i didn't have much to talk to myself. the urge to write is kinda back in me. As of today I think Aniket is back inside me. That over calculative bitch who always thinks about the most naive shit with the most precision. I feel good.

well now that i think about that, shutting down was worth it. when we broke up, I didn't give myself a chance to process it and made myself busy, that shit saved me from shattering like glass, i don't know what would've happened if this phase ended before patch up.

and well all this sounds a bit dramatic and weird, but yeah ill tell it to you anyways, i think youre gonna understand it.

just hours ago i was thinking about multi threading and async and watching a computerphile video when i suddenly snapped out of it.
